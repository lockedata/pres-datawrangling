## Agenda
 - Databases
 - Getting rows and columns
 - Altering columns
 - Aggregating data
 - Combining datasets
 
## Prerequisites
- R & RStudio
- RSQLite & rmarkdown
- kaggle.com/gabrio/board-games-dataset

# Databases

## Working with databases in R
```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
dbConn = dbConnect(SQLite(), "../database.sqlite")
```

## Our database
```{r}
dbListTables(dbConn)
```

## SQL Chunks
Use `{sql connection=dbConn}`!

```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name`, `attributes.boardgamecategory`
from boardgames 
limit 10
```

## Terminology
- A database is a collection of data
- A schema is a collection of related data
- A table is a collection of data on a specific event or entity
- A column is data on an attribute of the event or entity
- A row is a unique event or entity
- A key identifies a unique event or row

## Keys
- A key is a unique identifier of an entity or row
- A business key is one or more columns that uniquely describe an entity e.g. first name + last name + DOB
- A surrogate key is a numeric column that is easier to reference than the business key
- A primary key is typically the surrogate key

## Exercise
1. Create a markdown document and connect to the database. 
2. Can you use the `dbListColumns()` function to find out what columns are in the `boardgames` table?

## Answers
```{r}
dbListFields(dbConn,"boardgames")
```

# Getting rows and columns
## The core statement
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select *
from boardgames
limit 10
```

## Selecting columns
Use delimiters for bad names!
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name`, 
`attributes.boardgamecategory`
from boardgames
limit 10
```

## Selecting rows
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name`, 
`attributes.boardgamecategory`
from boardgames
where `attributes.boardgamecategory` like '%nautical%'
limit 10
```

## Selecting rows
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name`
,`attributes.boardgamecategory`
,`details.maxplayers`
from boardgames
where `attributes.boardgamecategory` like '%nautical%'
and `details.maxplayers` = 2 
limit 10
```

## Identifying missings
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name`
,`attributes.boardgameartist`
from boardgames
where `attributes.boardgameartist` is null
limit 10
```

## Exercise
1. Find all games with a `details.minage` of 16 or greater
2. Find all records where either the `attributes.boardgamedesigner` is missing or the `attributes.boardgameartist` is missing

## Answers
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name`
,`details.minage`
from boardgames
where `details.minage` >= 16
```

## Answers
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
 `details.name`
,`attributes.boardgamedesigner`
,`attributes.boardgameartist` 
from boardgames
where `attributes.boardgamedesigner` is null 
or `attributes.boardgameartist` is null
```

# Altering columns
## Renaming columns
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name` as `name`
from boardgames
limit 10
```

## Calculated columns
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.name` ,substr(`attributes.boardgamecategory`, 1,10) as short_category
, 1.2 as fixed_colum
, coalesce(`attributes.boardgameartist`,"Unknown") as arttist
,case when `attributes.boardgamecategory` like '%nautical%' then 'Boats, boats, boats!'
when `attributes.boardgamecategory` like '%pirate%' then 'R!' 
else 'Who cares?' end as category
from boardgames
where `attributes.boardgameartist` is null
limit 10
```

# Aggregating data

## Grouping data
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.maxplayers` as max_players
from boardgames
where `details.maxplayers` is not null
group by `details.maxplayers`
```


## Aggregates
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
`details.maxplayers` as max_players
,count(*) as n
,avg(`details.playingtime`) as avg_playtime
,avg(`details.playingtime`)/`details.maxplayers` as pp_avg_playtime
from boardgames
where `details.maxplayers` is not null
group by `details.maxplayers`
limit 10
```

## Exercises
1. How many games received ratings of 0,1,2,...,10 etc based on the ``stats.average` col? (Hint: Use the `floor()` function)
2. For records with the `game.type` of 'boardgameexpansion' what is the minimum, mean, and maximum of users who have said they want the expansion  (`stats.wanted`)?

## Answers
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
floor(`stats.average`) as rating
, count(*) as games
from boardgames
group by  floor(`stats.average`)
```

## Answers
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select avg(`stats.wishing` ) as avg_want
,min(`stats.wishing`) as min_want
,max(`stats.wishing`) as max_want
from boardgames
where `game.type`='boardgameexpansion'
```

# Combining datasets

## Combination types - inner join
Use when you need only stuff that matches on both sides

![inner join](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/blob/master/images/inner-join.gif?raw=true)

## Combination types - left join
Use when you you need to get potentially optional values from another table

![left join](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/blob/master/images/left-join.gif?raw=true)

## Combination types - union (all) 
Use when you you need to combine two separate datasets with the same structure

![union](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/blob/master/images/union.gif?raw=true)

## Writing joins
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
b.`details.name`
,t.`topics(bgg.ldaout)`
from boardgames b
inner join `bgg.ldaOut.topics` t on b.`details.name`=t.row_names
limit 10
```

## Exercises
1. Use a join to return any board games without a topic entry, turn the count of records
2. Can you transform the board game name column so that more entries get joined together? (Hint: Use the replace() function)

## Answers
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
count(*)
from boardgames b
left join `bgg.ldaOut.topics` t on b.`details.name`=t.row_names
where t.row_names is null
```

## Answers
```{sql connection=dbConn}
select 
count(*)
from boardgames b
left join `bgg.ldaOut.topics` t on replace(b.`details.name`,' ','.')=t.row_names
where t.row_names is null
```
